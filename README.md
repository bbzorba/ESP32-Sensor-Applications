# ESP32 Embedded Projects

This repository is a collection of various embedded projects developed using the ESP-IDF framework for the ESP32 WROOM 32 module. Each subdirectory within this repository will contain a self-contained ESP-IDF project.

## Getting Started

To build and flash these projects onto your ESP32, you'll need to set up your development environment.

## Prerequisites

###    ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework):

Follow the official Espressif installation guide for your operating system. This typically involves installing Git, CMake, Python, and the ESP-IDF tools.

ESP-IDF Programming Guide - Get Started

###    Required Software/Tools:

Git: For cloning the repository and managing versions.

CMake: Build system used by ESP-IDF.

Python: Essential for ESP-IDF scripts.

Serial Port Driver: Ensure you have the correct drivers for your ESP32 board's USB-to-serial chip (e.g., CP210x, FTDI).

## Setting up a Project

Each project in this repository is designed to be built independently.

Clone the Repository:
    

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name

### Navigate to a Project Directory:
Choose the project you want to work on. For example, if you have a blink project:


    cd blink

### Set up ESP-IDF Environment Variables:
Before building, you need to set up the ESP-IDF environment variables. This is typically done by sourcing the export.sh (Linux/macOS) or export.ps1 (Windows PowerShell) script located in your ESP-IDF installation directory.

Linux/macOS:
    
    . $IDF_PATH/export.sh

Windows (PowerShell):

    . $env:IDF_PATH/export.ps1

(Replace $IDF_PATH with your actual ESP-IDF installation path if it's not already set as an environment variable.)

### Configure the Project (Optional but Recommended):
You can configure project-specific settings (like serial port, Wi-Fi credentials, etc.) using menuconfig:

    idf.py menuconfig

### Build the Project:
Compile the source code:


    idf.py build


Alternatively, if you are using the provided Makefile (now located at the root of the repository and shared by all projects):

    make

**Important:**

- Before running any `make` command, you must edit the `Makefile` and set the following variables at the top of the file:
    - `PROJECT_DIR` — Set this to the absolute path of the project you want to build (e.g., `D:/baris/personal/personal_projects/ESP32/my_projects/blink`).
    - `PORT` — Set this to the serial port your ESP32 is connected to (e.g., `COM4`).
    - `IDF_PATH` — Set this to your ESP-IDF installation path (e.g., `C:/Users/youruser/esp/esp-idf`).

The Makefile requires absolute paths and cannot automatically detect your project or ESP-IDF installation directory. Each user must update these variables to match their own system.

### Flash the Project to ESP32:
Once built, flash the firmware to your ESP32 board. Ensure your ESP32 is connected and the correct serial port is selected (either in menuconfig or as PORT in your Makefile).

    idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash  # Linux/macOS example
    idf.py -p COM4 flash         # Windows example

If using the Makefile:

    make flash

(Replace /dev/ttyUSB0 or COM4 with your actual ESP32's serial port.)

### Monitor Serial Output (Optional):
To see the output from your ESP32, you can use the monitor:

    idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor # Linux/macOS example
    idf.py -p COM4 monitor         # Windows example

If using the Makefile:

    make monitor

## Project Structure and Customization

Each project directory will typically contain:

main/: Contains the main application source code.

CMakeLists.txt: CMake build script for the project.

sdkconfig: Project configuration generated by menuconfig.

## Important Note for Developers:

When adding new source files or changing the main build file for a project, you must modify the CMakeLists.txt file located inside the main directory of that specific project. This file specifies which source files are included in the build.

For example, to include led_blink.c in your build, your main/CMakeLists.txt might look like this:
CMake

    idf_component_register(SRCS "led_blink.c"
                       INCLUDE_DIRS ".")

If you add a new file named my_sensor_readings.c, you would update it to:
CMake

    idf_component_register(SRCS "led_blink.c"
                            "my_sensor_readings.c"
                       INCLUDE_DIRS ".")
